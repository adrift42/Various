# Description:			Load up a tmux session with a whole lot of panes automatically
#						sshing to a list of servers provided. Has a few options to customise.
#
# Options (required):	-f	takes a plaintext file with a list of servers (one per line). These
#							will be used to load up a tmux pane per server and kick off an ssh
#							connection
#						-s 	session name for tmux - needs to be unique if you have other tmux 
#							sessions running
# Options (optional):	-S	instead of the normal ssh command, adds on a keepalive argument if
#							you are expecting to be connected for a long time - prevents the ssh
#							connection from timing out. WARNING: can be considered not very 
#							security-conscious.
#
# Please offer any thoughts or additions either via issues or PRs
#
